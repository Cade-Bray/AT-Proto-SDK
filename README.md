# AT-Protocol Java SDK
This is a Java SDK for the AT-Protocol, a decentralized protocol for social networking. It provides a simple interface for interacting with AT-Protocol servers, allowing you to build decentralized social applications.

## Roadmap
Currently our roadmap is being defined. That being said the first stage is to build out the API GET/POST requests and the methods will currently return a HTTPResponse. In later versions I intend to parse the responses so you will not need to to yourself. Before moving to this stage we need to build out all responses and junit test them. This is a beginning product that is still very experimental.
