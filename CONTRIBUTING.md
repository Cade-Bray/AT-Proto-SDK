# Contributing Guidelines
We welcome contributions to the AT-Protocol Java SDK! Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

## Fork the Repo!
- Unless you're a contributor we do not accept branches and or commits to the main repo. Instead fork the repo, make a branch on your repo, make your commits, and make a pull request back to the repo!
- If you're a frequent contributor I will reach out to you to see if you'd like to be added as a contributor to our project!
- Try checking out the (first-contributions)[https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions] repo that will explain the general method to contributing to a open source project.

## Code Style
- Formatting: Please adhere to the official Java code style guidelines.
- Naming Conventions: Use clear and concise variable and method names.
- Comments: Add clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code sections.
- All methods and constructors must have an associated javadoc that contains parameters and return information.

## Commit Messages
- Clear and Concise: Use clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes made.
- Present Tense: Write commit messages in the present tense.
- Start with a Verb: Begin your commit message with a verb (e.g., "Fix", "Add", "Improve").

## Pull Requests
- Small, Focused Changes: Break down large changes into smaller, focused pull requests.
- Testing: Ensure your changes are well-tested and pass all existing tests.
- Include a unit testing file for any method you're working on.
- Code Review: Be prepared to address feedback from code reviewers.
- Rebase: Rebase your branch onto the main branch before submitting a pull request.

## Issues
- Search First: Before creating a new issue, search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Clear and Concise: Provide clear and concise descriptions of issues.
- Reproducible Steps: If applicable, provide reproducible steps to help with debugging.

## Code of Conduct
